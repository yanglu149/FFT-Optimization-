# FFT Multithreading on CPU & GPU

## Overview
This project implements Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) using the Cooley-Tukey algorithm, optimized for both CPU and GPU. It aims to demonstrate efficient multithreading techniques and the benefits of parallel computing in FFT calculations.

## Features
- **Serial FFT Implementation**: Utilizes the Cooley-Tukey algorithm for basic FFT calculations.
- **CPU Multithreading**: Implements FFT using Pthreads to leverage CPU cores for improved performance.
- **GPU Accelerated FFT**: Employs GPU capabilities for high-speed FFT processing.
- **Performance Analysis**: Includes comparisons between serial, multithreaded CPU, and GPU implementations.
- **Code Extensibility**: Structured for easy modification and extension for further research and optimization.
